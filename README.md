## Building Blocks
Create the block and its genesis block. Create a method for mining blocks. This used hashing function with SHA-256 algorithm which stands for secure S, hash H, algorithm A -256. The 256 part represents the fixed size of 256 bits for the hash which is 32 bytes. Or in other words 32 characters that will be generated to represent the hash. 

## Building Chain
Build the blockchain calss with multiple chain validation and chain replacement.

## Develop the Blockchain Application
Organize the Blockchain API and mine blocks post request using Postman.

## Blockchain Network
Peer to Peer server -- used a technology called web sockets to set up a virtually realtime connection between multiple nodes running a node.js application.

## Proof of Work
The proof of work system is one that requires miners to spend some time doing computational work to add blocks to the chain. This has the benefit of deterring dishonest peers from replacing the block chain with corrupt and invalid data.

## Collect Transactions in a Pool
Add Transaction Pool to the Peer to Peer Server. 

## Mine Transactions in a Block 
Used Postman to test it.
